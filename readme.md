# KeyCode Explorer

**KeyCode Explorer** is a simple and interactive web-based application that allows users to explore the details of any key pressed on their keyboard. It displays the key name, key code, and code property in a visually appealing format. This project is a great way to understand keyboard events and their properties in JavaScript.

   - The app listens for the `keydown` event on the window.  
   - When a key is pressed, the key details are dynamically displayed in a table format.

2. **Dynamic Updates**:  
   - The displayed key details update in real-time as the user presses different keys.

3. **Animation**:  
   - A subtle animation is triggered when a key is pressed, providing visual feedback.
